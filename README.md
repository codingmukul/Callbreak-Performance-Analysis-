3. Data visualization and some other stats can be checked in Growth Visualization sheet.

Features:

2. Line Chart and Smooth Line Chart for each player.
3. Pie Graph and Bar Graph for number of wins.
4. Parameters like Minimum Score, Maximum Score, Average Score, Median Score and Win Percentage for each player are also there.
